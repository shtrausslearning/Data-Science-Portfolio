    "\n",
    "- We cannot do an action & not do an action at the same time to the same person\n",

    "So what it this modeling approach about:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uplift modeling** is a technique that allows us to identify the subset of objects \n",
    "\n",
    "- who upon being influenced by an event/action will do some action\n",
    "- and if not influenced will not do the action\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>AN EXAMPLE</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "So lets think of an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we are selling a product and need to decide to whom we will be advertising, we have some constraints and cannot show it to all target audiences, \n",
    "\n",
    "- **we would like to find clients who will buy the product** if they see our advertisement \n",
    "- and **will and not buy it if they don't see it**\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> WHAT DO WE NEED FOR UPLIFT MODELING</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "In **uplift modeling** we need three components:\n",
    "\n",
    " Have two arrays we will be working with; **Treatment Array**, **Target Array** and standard **customer related feature matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    " - The **treatment array** is a binary vector, where we have no influence (0) and influenced (1)\n",
    " - The **target vector** is also a binary vector, where we have no action (0) and action is made (1)\n",
    " - The standard feature matrix (like other machine learning problems)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **<span style='color:#686dec'> What to remember</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "So some important things to note in the context of uplift modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To model which users will do an action when influenced & users which will not do an action when not influences we need to have aside from a standard feature matrix two additional vectors; **treatment** (users were identified and interacted with) & the result of our interaction with them, stored in the **target vector**\n",
    "- Having a trained model will enable us to identify on unseen data (without a treatment or target vector) the uplift value for a group for which we have a set of features used in training\n",
    "- Our aim is to target **influencible clients** (those who upon being interacted with will commit a target action) and those when not interacted with will not conduct a target action."

We utilise the model on our new dataset and obtain the uplift values for each customer in our new client batch. Lets define some uplift criteria for filtering out clients to whom we wish to send an identical marketing campaign as before. Based on the what the model learned in the previous data, clients with a high uplift will likely end up going through with the purchases, our marketing campaign should just remind them of the opporunity we are providing them, and the feedback is expected to be mostly positive."

    "In this post we looked into a brief introduction into **uplift modeling**, which is a practical business task for which we can utilise machine learning & use modeling for the prediction/identification of the subset of objects/dataset **who upon being influenced by an event/action will do some action** and **if not influenced will not do the action**\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked at two approaches **s-learner** & **t-learner** modeling approaches and tried a sample problem **Kevin Hillstrom Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling approaches allow us to predict the lift value, and gives us to understanding how well the particular client is influenced based on historical data, the models can then be used on new unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can repeat the process similar to above using some other datasets such as: [fetch_x5](https://www.uplift-modeling.com/en/latest/api/datasets/fetch_x5.html), [fetch_lenta](https://www.uplift-modeling.com/en/latest/api/datasets/fetch_lenta.html#lenta-uplift-modeling-dataset), [fetch_megafon](https://www.uplift-modeling.com/en/latest/api/datasets/fetch_megafon.html).\n"
