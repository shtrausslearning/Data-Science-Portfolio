|Project Name| Description | Type | Kaggle Notebook | GitHub | Views | Upvotes | Forks |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Heart Disease Gaussian Process Models | In this study, we explore different feature engineering approaches for predicting heart disease, using Gaussian Process Classification, using a custom model which we wrote | Binary Classification | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/heart-disease-gaussian-process-models)** | None | 3814 | 110 | 60 |
| Bayesian Regression House Price Prediction | In this study we try out a model based imputation approach, investigate outliers, do some feature engineering & create models that can predict the house price using our custom bayesian linear regression model, which is compatible with sklearn pipelines | Regression | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/bayesian-regression-house-price-prediction)** | None | 15561 | 192 | 268 |
| Geospatial Data Visualisation Australia | In this study, we explore different techniques commonly used for geospatial data visualisation & also look into interpolation method Kriging. For each approach we also look at some sample problems | Exploratory Data Analysis | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/geospatial-data-visualisation-australia)** | None | 9515 | 167 | 174 | 
| Customer Transaction Predictive Analytics | Part of the **[Data@ANZ](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/ZLJCsrpkHo9pZBJNY/ANZ-Virtual-Internship)** Internship program. The aim of the study is to analyse customer transactions & find their annual income. Based on the deduced data, we needed to create a model that will be able to predict their annual income| Regression | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/customer-transaction-predictive-analytics)** | None | 1575 | 58 | 24 | 
| Financial Consumer Complaint Analysis | In this study, we aim to create an automated ticket classification model, which will is able to determine which category of consumer feedback the input text belongs to. We explore traditional ML methods, utilising hidden state BERT embedding data, as well as fine tune DistilBert for our classification problem  | Multiclass Classification | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/nlp-financial-consumer-complaint-analysis)** | None | 227 | 16 | 2 |
| Twitter Emotion Classification | In this study, we am to deduce the sentiment of user tweets, we look at more traditional ML methods, which utilise BERT embeddings, as well as fine tune DistilBERT for our classification problem | Multiclass Classification | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/nlp-twitter-emotion-classification)** | None | 1446 | 17 | 40 | 
| edX Course Recommendations | In this study, we create a recommendation system for edX online courses, based on cosine similarity | Recommendation | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/nlp-edx-course-recommendations)** | None | 470 | 18 | 10 |
| Creating a Transformer Encoder w/ Attention | In this study, we create an Transformer-Encoder Head in PyTorch, which utilises an attention mechanism. The model is then utilised for classification, for which we create a Classifier Head | Implementation | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/nlp-creating-a-transformer-encoder-w-attention)** | None | 171 | 17 | 2 | 
| CFD Trade-Off Study Visualisation Response Model | In this study, we do an exploratory data analysis of a CFD optimisation study, aiming to find the most optimal design using different visualisation techniques. The data is then utilised to create a response model for L/D, we investigate which approaches work the best | Regression | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/cfd-trade-off-study-visualisation-response-model)** | None | 2314 | 119 | 54 |
| Gaussian Processes Airfoil Noise Modeling | In this study, we do an exploratory data analysis of experimental data associated with airfoil noise, we outline the dependencies of parameter and setting variation and its influence on noise level. The data is then used to create a machine learning model, which will be able to predict the sound pressure level (SPL) | Regression | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/gaussian-processes-airfoil-noise-modeling)** | None | 2154 | 103 | 42 |
