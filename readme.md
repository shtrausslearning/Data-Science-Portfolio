|-:|-|-|-|-|
| **Customer Transaction Predictive Analytics** | Part of the **[Data@ANZ](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/ZLJCsrpkHo9pZBJNY/ANZ-Virtual-Internship)** Internship program. The aim of the study is to analyse customer transactions & find their annual income. Based on the deduced data, we needed to create a model that will be able to predict their annual income| Regression | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/customer-transaction-predictive-analytics)** | None |
| **Financial Consumer Complaint Analysis** | In this study, we aim to create an automated ticket classification model, which will is able to determine which category of consumer feedback the input text belongs to. We explore traditional ML methods, utilising hidden state BERT embedding data, as well as fine tune DistilBert for our classification problem  | Multiclass Classification | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/nlp-financial-consumer-complaint-analysis)** | None |
