|Project Name| Description | Type | Kaggle Notebook | GitHub | Views | Upvotes | Forks |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Heart Disease Gaussian Process Models | In this study, we explore different feature engineering approaches for predicting heart disease, using Gaussian Process Classification, using a custom model which we wrote | Binary Classification | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/heart-disease-gaussian-process-models)** | None | 3814 | 110 | 60 |
| Bayesian Regression House Price Prediction | In this study we try out a model based imputation approach, investigate outliers, do some feature engineering & create models that can predict the house price using our custom bayesian linear regression model, which is compatible with sklearn pipelines | Regression | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/bayesian-regression-house-price-prediction)** | None | 15561 | 192 | 268 |
| Geospatial Data Visualisation Australia | In this study, we explore different techniques commonly used for geospatial data visualisation & also look into interpolation method Kriging. For each approach we also look at some sample problems | Exploratory Data Analysis | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/geospatial-data-visualisation-australia)** | None | 9515 | 167 | 174 | 
| Customer Transaction Predictive Analytics | Part of the **[Data@ANZ](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/ZLJCsrpkHo9pZBJNY/ANZ-Virtual-Internship)** Internship program. The aim of the study is to analyse customer transactions & find their annual income. Based on the deduced data, we needed to create a model that will be able to predict their annual income| Regression | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/customer-transaction-predictive-analytics)** | None | 1575 | 58 | 24 |
