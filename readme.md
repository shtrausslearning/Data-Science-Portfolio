|Project Name| Description | Type | Kaggle Notebook | GitHub | Views | Upvotes | Forks |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Heart Disease Gaussian Process Models | In this study, we explore different feature engineering approaches for predicting heart disease, using Gaussian Process Classification, using a custom model which we wrote | Binary Classification | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/heart-disease-gaussian-process-models)** | None | 3814 | 110 | 60 |
| Bayesian Regression House Price Prediction | In this study we try out a model based imputation approach, investigate outliers, do some feature engineering & create models that can predict the house price using our custom bayesian linear regression model, which is compatible with sklearn pipelines | Regression | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/bayesian-regression-house-price-prediction)** | None | 15561 | 192 | 268 |
| Geospatial Data Visualisation Australia | In this study, we explore different techniques commonly used for geospatial data visualisation & also look into interpolation method Kriging. For each approach we also look at some sample problems | Exploratory Data Analysis | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/geospatial-data-visualisation-australia)** | None | 9515 | 167 | 174 | 
| Customer Transaction Predictive Analytics | Part of the **[Data@ANZ](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/ZLJCsrpkHo9pZBJNY/ANZ-Virtual-Internship)** Internship program. The aim of the study is to analyse customer transactions & find their annual income. Based on the deduced data, we needed to create a model that will be able to predict their annual income| Regression | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/customer-transaction-predictive-analytics)** | None | 1575 | 58 | 24 | 
| Financial Consumer Complaint Analysis | In this study, we aim to create an automated ticket classification model, which will is able to determine which category of consumer feedback the input text belongs to. We explore traditional ML methods, utilising hidden state BERT embedding data, as well as fine tune DistilBert for our classification problem  | Multiclass Classification | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/nlp-financial-consumer-complaint-analysis)** | None | 227 | 16 | 2 |
| Twitter Emotion Classification | In this study, we am to deduce the sentiment of user tweets, we look at more traditional ML methods, which utilise BERT embeddings, as well as fine tune DistilBERT for our classification problem | Multiclass Classification | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/nlp-twitter-emotion-classification)** | Non | 1446 | 17 | 40 |
