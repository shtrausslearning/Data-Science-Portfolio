|Project Name| Description | Type | Kaggle Notebook | GitHub | Views | Upvotes | Forks |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Heart-Disease Gaussian Process Models | In this project, we explore different feature engineering approaches for predicting heart disease, using Gaussian Process Classification, using a custom model which we wrote | Binary Classification | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/heart-disease-gaussian-process-models)** | None | 3814 | 110 | 60 |
| Bayesian Regression House Price Prediction | In this study we try out a model based imputation approach, investigate outliers, do some feature engineering & create models that can predict the house price using our custom bayesian linear regression model, which is compatible with sklearn pipelines | Regression | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/bayesian-regression-house-price-prediction)** | None | 15561 | 192 | 268 |
