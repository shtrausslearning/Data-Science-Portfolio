| **Customer Transaction Predictive Analytics** | [![name](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notebook-Kaggle-FAE01C)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/customer-transaction-predictive-analytics) [![name](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repository-Github-F97429)](https://github.com/shtrausslearning/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/ANZ_internship) <br> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Information-4169E1) Part of the **[Data@ANZ](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/ZLJCsrpkHo9pZBJNY/ANZ-Virtual-Internship)** Internship program. The aim of the study is to analyse customer transactions & find their annual income. Based on the deduced data, we needed to create a model that will be able to predict their annual income. Two approaches were investigates, transaction based (all transactions) & customer aggregative (customer's transaction). <br><br>| [![name](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notebook-Kaggle-FAE01C)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/customer-transaction-predictive-analytics) <br> [![name](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repository-Github-F97429)](https://github.com/shtrausslearning/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/ANZ_internship) | 
| **Ovarian Phase Classification in Felids** |[![name](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notebook-Kaggle-FAE01C)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/ovarian-phase-classification-in-felids) [![name](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notebook-Github-F97429)](https://github.com/shtrausslearning/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/ovarian-phase-classification-in-felids.ipynb) <br> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Information-4169E1) In this study, we investigate feline reproductology, conducting an exploratory data analysis, attempting to find the relation between different hormone levels during different phases of pregnancy. We also create models that are able to predict at which stage of an estrous cycle a feline is at the time of testing | 
| **Financial Consumer Complaint Analysis** | In this study, we aim to create an automated ticket classification model, which will is able to determine which category of consumer feedback the input text belongs to. We explore traditional ML methods, utilising hidden state BERT embedding data, as well as fine tune DistilBert for our classification problem  | **[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/nlp-financial-consumer-complaint-analysis)**|
