**Step 1: Data modeling**

Look at the data model provided in the additional resources. Look at all the data that is now available from the client and decide what you want to use for the modeling of the problem statement. This should take 10-15 minutes.

**Step 2: Strategic planning**

Come up with a plan as to how youâ€™ll use this data to solve the problem statement that the client has positioned. This plan will be used to describe to the client how we are planning to complete the remaining work and to build trust with the client as a domain expert. If you need some guidance, use the provided resource video that describes the high-level overview of a data science project. This should take 10-15 minutes.

**Step 3: Communication**

Summarize the data that you want to make use of and the strategic plan of action in a single PowerPoint slide. This will be sent to the Data Science team leader and the client, so be sure to be concise and use business-friendly language. This should take 10-15 minutes. 

Estimated time for task completion: 30-45 minutes, depending on your learning style.
