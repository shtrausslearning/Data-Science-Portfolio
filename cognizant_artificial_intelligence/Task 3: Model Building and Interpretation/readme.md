### **Task 3: Model Building and Interpretation**

You have previously outlined the strategic plan for completing the modeling work based on the problem statement.

It is now time for you to deliver on this strategic plan. Some additional resources have been provided to help you with this task. If you feel comfortable enough to complete this task on your own, use the “modeling.ipynb” Python notebook to get started. However, if you’re not sure where to start and would like to be guided through the modeling process, use the “modeling_walkthrough.ipynb” notebook. 

Feel free to use these notebooks in a similar way that we did before, using Google Colab. If you prefer to use them within your own development environment, that’s fine too.

The modeling process should take 35-45 minutes.

Once you’re done with the modeling, summarize your results in a business-friendly single PowerPoint slide. Be sure to explain whether this model can help them to tackle the problem statement.

This should take 10-15 minutes.

Estimated time for task completion: 45-60 minutes, depending on your learning style.
